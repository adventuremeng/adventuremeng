Hello! My name is Meng Gao. I am a city planner working in the U.S. I graduated from the Master of City and Regional Planning program at Georgia Tech in May 2019. Before that, I studied Architecture at Xi'an Jiaotong University in Xi'an, China. At work, I focus on community planning using GIS and data-driven methods. I am interested in GIS, statistics, and R. 

In my spare time, I like salsa dancing, playing the flute, going to the gym, and posting videos (in Chinese) on [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/12234819) weekly.
