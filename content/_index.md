Hello! My name is Meng Gao. I am a city planner working in the U.S. I graduated from the Master of City and Regional Planning program at Georgia Tech in May 2019. Before that, I studied Architecture at Xi'an Jiaotong University in Xi'an, China. At work, I focus on community planning using GIS and data-driven methods. I am interested in GIS, statistics, and R. 

I built this website using RStudio's package: [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). In my spare time, I like salsa dancing and ACG-related dancing. I play the flute, do Hapkido, and post videos (in Chinese) on [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/12234819) weekly.
