### About Me



I am currently a transit planner and data analyst working at [Nelson\Nygaard Consulting Associates](https://nelsonnygaard.com/) in Seattle, Washington. At work, I support and lead a wide range of transit planning projects including comprehensive operational analyses and system redesigns, transit development plans, corridor studies, etc. I use R and GIS a lot to automate our work process, conduct data analysis and create dashboards/tools that better supports planning.

I am most interested in GIS, statistics, and R. During work and personal researching time, I like to combine data-driven information and geospatial info with traditional planning methods to better understand and solve urban problems regarding social justice.

In May 2019, I graduated from the Master of City and Regional Planning program at Georgia Tech with a GIS certificate. Before that, I studied Architecture at Xi'an Jiaotong University in Xi'an, China.

### About the Adventure 

Study, work, and have fun. I consider these elements of life as Meng Adventure.

Recently I started teaching myself sewing. If it's a typical raining day in Seattle, I will be sewing at home. It's a lot of fun!
