### About Me


<a href="/images/Meng_Gao_Resume_Dec2019.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color:blue">Download my latest Resume here.</span> </a> Last update: December, 2019.

I am currently working for APD Urban Planning and Management, Atlanta. APD provides comprehensive neighborhood planning, real estate development, and housing and community development. At work, I utilize data collection, analysis, and visualization to reveal community insights and development opportunities.

In May 2019, I graduated from the Master of City and Regional Planning program at Georgia Tech concentrating in GIS and urban design. Before that, I studied Architecture at Xi'an Jiaotong University in Xi'an, China. You can find my architecture portfolio below.

Recently, I am most interested in GIS, statistics, and R. My goal is to use data-driven information, geospatial relationships, and design aspects to understand and solve urban problems. I like to study about neighborhood gentrification, housing market dynamics, non-motorized transportation promotion, and environmental and social justice problems. 

**You can find my previous studies [here](/doc). You can also find my skill sets [here](/about).**

### About the Adventure 

Study, work, and have fun. I consider these elements of life as Meng Adventure.

In my spare time, I like salsa dancing, playing the flute, going to the gym, and posting videos (in Chinese) on [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/12234819) weekly.
