This urban design project was the product of a group project for Urban Ecological Design course. Group member: Meng Gao, Jonathan Sherman, Jian Pang, and Chris Chang.

Our design, “Tech Playground” is a conceptual campus design for Georgia Tech’s Shenzhen Campus, China. The site is located on the south of Subway Line 5, Tanglang Station(塘朗). The site is surrounded by urban complex and other campus buildings. This design utilized the existing topology and formed the major corridor, with teaching buildings and dormitories along the corridor. The “Tech Playground” concept integrated landscape design and activity design, while focusing on low-carbon technology and ecological design ideas.
