Year 2019 is over. This is definitely a very important year for me as I am very thankful of what happened, what I did, and people who supported me.

In the meanwhile, I had several mental breakdowns; I got sick several times; I questioned life and world several times; I failed various goals. I might not get what I want. I might experience similar or even worse down time again and again in 2020. 

Whether I am ready or not, 2020 is already here. So, here we go! Hope everything is well in the new year, and hope I can achieve similar good stats like the good old 2019!
