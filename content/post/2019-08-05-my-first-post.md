Hi! Welcome to my personal website! 

When I was in Georgia Tech, I was the Webmaster for Student Planning Association. I built and managed our organization website for marketing, event archiving, and collecting submissions. However, we used a website builder service. Please check out our website here: [Student Planning Association](https://www.georgiatechspa.com/). The site is currently managed by SPA's new Webmaster: Luben.

I had the idea of building my personal website after learning about the R Package: blogdown. I read the book [blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown] (https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and followed this tutorial to deploy my website - Alison Hill: [Up & Running with blogdown](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/).

Here it is! My website. I am still working on it to put up both my professional posts and personal posts. Please come back again!

Also, you can contact me by clicking the mail button on the bottom of the page to send me an email.

Woo hoo!
